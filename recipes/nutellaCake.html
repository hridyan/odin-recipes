    <h1>The easiest cake you dont even need to bake</h1>
    <img src="../images/NutellaMugCake.jpg">

    <p>This is the <strong>easiest</strong> cake you will ever bake in your entite life. This is because it takes a mind-boggling <em>3</em> ingredients and 1 microwave</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup + 1 tablespoon (3 ¼ oz/90g) Nutella </li>
        <li>1 large egg* , gently whisked</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large microwavable mug add the Nutella and egg* and whisk together.</li>
        <li>Add flour and mix until you have a smooth batter.</li>
        <li>Microwave for roughly 45 seconds - 1 minute. (Cooking time is based on my 1200W so your timing might vary). Always keep a close eye on your mug while in the microwave so it doesn’t overflow or overcook.</li>
        <li>When the brownie is set and firm on top it is done. Let the brownie cool and minutes before serving</li>
        <li>Serve with some vanilla ice cream while it’s still warm.</li>
    </ol>
