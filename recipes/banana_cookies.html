    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 small overripe mashed bananas</li>
        <li>1 cup old fashioned rolled oats</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F, and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the bananas in a bowl and mash them with the back of a spoon (to ensure the best results, measure your mashed banana into a 1 cup measuring cup.) Add the oats and stir to combine. </li>
        <li>Spray the parchment paper with cooking spray and drop heaping spoonfuls of the batter onto the baking sheet. This recipe should yield about 12 cookies.</li>
        <li>Place the cookies in the oven and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the tops are lightly browned and crisp. Let cool for a few minutes, then enjoy!</li>
